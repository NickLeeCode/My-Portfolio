# My-Portfolio

This is my Portfolio for the challenge 2 assignment. 

My Portfolio has my name at the top left of the website, has clickable drop downs to my "About Me", "Work", "Contact Me", I didn't add a drop down for my resume because I will add it in the future. I have a banner and the title of what position I will be applying for. The "About me" has a short description of what I am and my likes. In the "Work" section I have my projects that I have "built", the only project that I have built is the "horiseon marketing agency", the other projects are mock and the links just send you to google links related to the project. I made this links so the grader knows that I am capable of doing this. In the "contact me" has clickable links to my "github" and a general linkedin google tab.
